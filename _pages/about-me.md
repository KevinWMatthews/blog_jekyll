# Hello, I'm Kevin.

I a software developer for embedded systems.

Most of my daily work is in C and Python but I've used and studied C++, Ruby,
JavaScript, and a little bit of Rust.

I'm hooked on fast feedback loops, automated tests, and solutions that are
designed to evolve.

I strive to craft thoughtful, clean, testable code because I like to be proud of
what I deploy.

I'll do it but I love to do it well.
