## Title here

To change behavior at run time, use function pointers. Polymorphism of sorts.
To change behavior at compile-time, swap modules using conditional compilation.
This is very powerful if two modules implement the same interface.
Behavior can also be modified at link time. Very useful for unit testing.
(not covered yet).
