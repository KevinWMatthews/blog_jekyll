# What is this all about?

This blog is an outlet for my growth as a software developer - a collection of
ideas on how to craft quality code.

The examples center around design patterns, testing strategies, and how
these vary between languages.

The goal of each post is to actually do the thing in question, so
code examples are part of working projects. These are available
[on GitHub](https://kevinwmatthews.github.io/).
