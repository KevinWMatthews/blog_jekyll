# Hello, I'm Kevin.

I'm software developer.

I work on embedded systems professionally.
Most of my daily work is in C but I frequently use Python and JavaScript.

I'm interested in how languages affect solutions so I've been studying
Rust, C++, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and a little bit of Elm.

I'm hooked on fast feedback loops, automated tests, and solutions that are
designed to evolve.

I strive to craft thoughtful, clean, testable code because I like to be proud of
what I deploy.

I'll do it but I love to do it well.
